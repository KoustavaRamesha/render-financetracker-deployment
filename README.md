Firebase Configuration (Environment Variables):For a production deployment or local development outside of a controlled environment, you would typically use a .env file. Since this app uses a static firebaseConfig block, ensure your Firebase project's keys match the configuration within the main React component file, especially if you plan to share this on GitHub.Note for Canvas/Immersive Users: The application is configured to automatically detect and use the injected environment variables (__app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token) for seamless operation.Development Server StartupRun the application locally:npm start
# or
yarn start
The application should open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:3000.📖 Usage Guide1.
